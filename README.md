# Association_Rule_Mining
Association rule mining is a well-known data mining technique used to find associations between items or itemsets. In today’s big data environment, association rule mining has to be extended to big data. The Apriori algorithm is one of the most commonly used algorithms for association rule mining. Using the Apriori algorithm, we find frequent patterns, that is, patterns that occur frequently in data. The Apriori algorithm employs an iterative approach where k-itemsets are used to explore (k + 1) itemsets.This rule shows how frequently a itemset occurs in a transaction. A typical example is Market Based Analysis.**Given a set of transactions, we can find rules that will predict the occurrence of an item based on the occurrences of other items in the transaction.**
